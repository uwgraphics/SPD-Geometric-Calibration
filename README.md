## Glossary

`calibration` folder contains the optimization code and utility functions for performing the calibration procedure

`data` folder contains real-world and simulated data used to produce plots in the paper. While each script contains the code to generate its own data, setting `GEN_DATA=False` at the top of the script will cause the script to read in from the stored data file, saving time.

`figures` folder contains final figures as they appear in the paper, and as they are generated by the scripts.

Scripts in the root directory correspond to figures in the paper:

|Figure|Script|
|----|----|
|Fig. 4| `initial_est_test.py` |
|Fig. 5| `degen_1.py` `degen_2.py` `degen_3.py` |
|Fig. 6| `vary_obs.py` |
|Fig. 7| `vary_noise.py` |
|Fig. 9| `plane_reconstruction.py` |
